Turn your SQL queries to Beautiful Dynamic Charts

== Description ==
The plugin can create beautiful Local and Google Charts based on your SQL queries, then you can use those charts in any part of your website.
You can use both native wp and non-wp mysql tables in your queries. 

1. Give any name to your report.

2. Use our preinstalled chart or create new one yourself: choose desired chart type, type sql query, 
enter field names, labels and then press to Publish/Update

3. You can use multiple SQL queries too. Just split them by ; sign. You can add shortcode argument to SQL query. For example if you 
type "select * from wp_posts where ID>{arg1}" then it you can pass arg1 value to the query with  [gvn_schart_2 id="2" arg1="11"] shortcode. 

4. After update/save you will see needed shortcode below there. You can use that shortcode anywhere in your website: in pages, posts, widgets etc.
